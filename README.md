# logseq-vim-mode
A better set of vim keybindings in logseq

## Logic

 - ctrl+key commands are vim commands - performing them in vim without ctrl has a near identical effect
 - alt+key commands are best effort vimmish - the effect or key combo is analogous to vim when that applies

## Exceptions


 - Toggle commands left alone for now
 - Moving blocks comes from the [recommendation in the wiki](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Moving_lines_up_or_down)
 - Go to home is slanted bash (ctrl + ~)
 - I don't use journals, so it was disabled to make room for block moving
